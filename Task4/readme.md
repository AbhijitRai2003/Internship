# 🌐 Multi-Page Responsive Website

Welcome to my **multi-page responsive website** project!  
It’s a clean, simple, and mobile-friendly site with **four pages** — **Home**, **About**, **Services**, and **Contact** — all connected by a shared navigation bar.  
No fancy frameworks, just **pure HTML & CSS**.
