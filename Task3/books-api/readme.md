# 📚 Books REST API with Node.js & Express

A simple REST API for managing a list of books using **Node.js** and **Express**.  
Supports full CRUD operations — **Create, Read, Update, Delete** — and can be tested using **Postman**.  
Data is stored **in-memory** (inside an array), so it resets when the server restarts.

- **POST** `/books` → Add a new book
- **PUT** `/books/:id` → Update an existing book by ID
